-- MRBind's binding generators, without its parser.
--
-- This is the plugin-side counterpart to thirdparty/packages/mrbind.lua. A
-- plugin project never parses C++: the engine did that once and shipped the
-- result as feather_api.json, and turning that JSON into C headers or C#
-- sources is all a plugin build has to do.
--
-- That distinction is what makes this package cheap. mrbind_gen_c and
-- mrbind_gen_csharp link no Clang and no LLVM -- only the parser does -- so
-- with MRBIND_BUILD_PARSER=OFF this builds with a plain host compiler in a
-- couple of minutes, instead of potentially building LLVM from source. It also
-- means a plugin author needs no Clang installation, and no engine checkout.
--
-- Keep the git revision in sync with thirdparty/packages/mrbind.lua: the
-- parser's JSON schema is undocumented and unversioned upstream, so a
-- generator from a different revision may not read the engine's api.json.
